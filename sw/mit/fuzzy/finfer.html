<body>
<h1>finfer.r</h1>
<a href="finfer.r"><em>finfer.r</em></a> is a 
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> file containing a fuzzy
rule inference engine. The implementation consists of a handful
functions making up around 20 lines of code. The remaining 10 lines or
so are helper function for defining fuzzy sets.

<h3>Wow! That must be some expensive software!</h3>
Actually, no. It is distributed as free (not as in beer) software
under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU General Public Licence</a>.
Read the licence before using it.

<h3>Anything else I should know?</h3>

Yes, there are two accompanying files:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="landerdemo.r">landerdemo.r</a>, a usage demonstration that
    contains definitions that in conjunction with the contents of
    finfer.r make up a simple fuzzy controller that is used in an animated
    simulation landing a planetary lander on planet X. It also uses
    finfer-logging.r to analyze the rule base
    (<a href="ml-ractiv.png">here</a> for image).
  <li> <a href="finfer-logging.r">finfer-logging.r</a> contains code
    to enable logging of rule activations.
</ul>

The quickest way to try it out is to download all three files, start R,
and then do
<pre>
> source('landerdemo.r')
> landerdemo()
</pre>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

The code has been tested under R version 2.6.2 under linux and
windows XP. Mac users might have to redefine the test for animation in
landerdemo.r.

<h3>Great! Let me have it!</h3>
Ok, grab the files from the links above, or go get gzipped tar
archive <a href="finfer.tgz">HERE</a>.
