DESCRIPTION
       eda is an estimation of distributions algorithm library	for  orderings
       on  the	numbers	0,1,...,N-1  for some positive N. Code that uses this
       library would look something like the following.

       #include <eda.h>
       #include <iostream>

       #include <util.h>
       using util::operator<<;
       using util::operator>>;

       class MyObjective : public Objective
       {
	 vector<int> target;
       public:
	 MyObjective(vector<int> &t) : Objective(maximize), target(t) {}
	 virtual ~MyObjective(){}
	 score_t raw(vector<int> &ind) {
	   int sum = 0;
	   for(vector<int>::iterator i = ind.begin() + 1; i != ind.end(); i++)
	     sum += static_cast<int>(target[*(i - 1)] <= target[*i]);
	   return static_cast<score_t>(sum);
	 }
       };


       int main()
       {
	 vector<int> t;
	 std::cin >> t;
	 MyObjective o(t);
	 vector< pair<int,int> > zers; // disallowed transitions, here none
	 Distribution d(t.size(), zers);
	 EDA eda(d, o);
	 eda.run();
	 std::cout << eda.sol();
       }



       The  above  code	comes	from  the  file	example.cc supplied with this
       library, and can be compiled with (after	installing  the  library  and
       header files)
       $ g++ -o example example.cc -leda -lgmpxx -lgmp
       and run as
       $ echo 3 2 1 4 100 5 | ./example
       or can be compiled and run by
       $ make test



FILES
       The library consists of a number of files.

   Header files
       eda.h
	 is  the  main header file to be included by code that is to be linked
	 with this library.

       farith.h
	 used by the library for  floating  point  arithmetic.	Uses  the  gmp
	 library to avoid numerical instabilities.

       objective.h
	 is the entry point to the library, defines the objective function.

       parameter.h
	 is  a	sub-library that allows object-oriented access to command line
	 parameters. Might be taken out of this library in the future.

       compose2.h
	 used by the command-line parameter part of the library

       util.h
	 are utilities used by the library (templates)


   CC files
       eda.cc

       farith.cc

       parameter.cc

DEPENDENCIES
       This library is dependent on the GNU gmp	library  and  has  only  been
       tested	with  g++ 3.3.{1,3}.  The linking flags should include -lgmpxx
       -lgmp

BUGS
       Must be plenty. Please report them to the author. Thank you.
