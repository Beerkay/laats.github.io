.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsp 
is a utility that searches for tours using a configurable
estimation of distributions algorithm. The input is a square matrix
representation of the distances between the points that the salesman
has to visit exactly once. Any single precision floating point values
are acceptable. The value of 1000000 is interpreted as a
non-connection.
.LP
The output is a permutation of the natural numbers 0 through number of
cities - 1, representing the tour.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v, --verbose
Spew information...
.TP
.B -h, --help
print rudimentary help on usage.
.TP
.B -p, --psize  <value>
Default value: 100.
Population sise to use
.TP
.B --dv  <value>
Default value: 10000.
Sets dv used in probability scaling.
.TP
.B --df  <value>
Default value: 100.
Sets df used in probability scaling.
.TP
.B -n, --niter  <value>
Default value: 100.
Sets number of generations with
no improvement to wait before quitting.
.TP
.B -e, --nest  <value>
Default value: 30.
Sets number of best individuals to use each
generation to update the distribution estimate.
.TP
.B -f, --logfile  <value>
Default value: cerr.
Where to print log.
.TP
.B -l, --log
Turn on logging of generational stats.
.TP
.B --loginterval  <value>
Default value: 20.
Sets the number of generations to wait between each log output.
.TP
.B -a, --alpha  <value>
Default value: 0.15.
Sets alpha, the distribution update speed.
After each generation a subsample is used to estimate the
distribution, initially this is uniform. Then, the distribution is
updated using the previous distribution estimate and this current
estimate. 
.I alpha 
governs the speed of this according to
.EQ
next = (1-alpha)*old + alpha*current.
.EN
.TP
.B -i, --nelite  <value>
Default value: 3.
How many of the best to transfer to the next population.
.TP
.B -s, --seed  <value>
Default value: none.
Initialize random number generator with the given seed.
.TP
.B -m, --maxgen  <value>
Default value: none.
Maximal number of generations to run.
.TP
.B --version
Default value: none.
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B -r, --report
Default value: none.
Also report number of generations and score.
.SH INPUT FORMATS
.SS distance matrix
The square 
.I n 
times 
.I n 
distance matrix must be input as 
.I n
lines of text containing exactly
.I n
numbers, either single
precision floating point numbers, or integers that can fit into a
single point floating point number.
.SH EXAMPLES
$ tsp < intputfile
.P
$ cat inputfile | tsp -l --loginterval 10 --dv 1000 --alpha 0.6 -p 500 
.P
$ tsp -h
.LP
If the input file 
.I example.input 
contains:
.P
0 6.231753 6.417581
.br
1e+06 0 9.933639
.br
5.936391 7.555658 0
.P
Then we can expect output of
.br

.br
$ tsp -l -n 10 -v < example.input
.br

.br
to resemble something like:
.br

.br
Parameter verbose ('v') was set to 1 
.br
Parameter niter ('n') was set to 10 
.br
Parameter log ('l') was set to 1 
.br

.SH DEPENDENCIES
This program is dependent on the eda and GNU gmp libraries, and has only been
tested  with g++ 3.3.{1,3}.
.SH FEATURES
The program requires the input from stdin. Even though the value
1000000 (one million) is interpreted as a non-connection, there is no
guarantee that a tour will only consist of cities between there is a
different cost. 
.SH BUGS
Must be plenty. Please report them to the
author. Thank you.
